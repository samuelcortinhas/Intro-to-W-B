Introduction to Weights & Biases

# About

I made these notebooks whilst learning to use the MLOps platform Weights & Biases in Nov 2022. These notebooks were originally posted on kaggle ([see here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samuelcortinhas/catalogue-of-my-kaggle-notebooks)) and are intended to be for others to learn from.
